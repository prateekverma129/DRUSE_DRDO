STANLEY-A Self-Concealing Unmanned Ground Vehicle
A Project in collaboration with DRDO Robotics and Unmanned System Exposition. Some military organizations take the help of UGV in the risk prone areas which are not that effective when done by army men. Stanley is a Self-Concealing UGV that is equipped with modern technology that enables it to conceal itself by various methods in response to a threat from the enemy.

The UGV Stanley is designed to accomplish two tasks i.e. camouflaging and concealing with the help of digging. The upper circular cover part of the UGV is made transparent so as to depict camouflaging more effectively.
The major parts which we require to show camouflaging are:
 Micro-Controller
 PIR Sensor
 Colour Sensor
 Bluetooth Module
 LED Matrix

The UGV possesses camouflaging behavior by virtue of which

1. it changes its colour and adapts itself to the colour of the surroundings, thus deceiving the enemy.

2 .it changes its temperature according to surrounding hence hide from thermal imaging.

 3. it can aquire desired shape with the help of silicon skin as an octapus do.

The UGV also has high power driven drillers that impart high torque to the system and make drilling easy.
The major parts that help in digging are:
 High power driven drillers
 Blade
 Blade Lift Cylinder
 Angle/Tilt Cylinder
 Tyres
 Power Supply Circuit
